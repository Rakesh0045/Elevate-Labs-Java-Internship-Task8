1. What are Java loops?  
Loops in Java are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Types of loops include `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

2. What is enhanced for-loop?  
The enhanced for-loop (also called for-each loop) is a simplified `for` loop used for iterating over arrays and collections.

Example:  
for (String item : list) {  
    System.out.println(item);  
}

3. How do you handle multiple user inputs?  
Use `Scanner` class for input. Loop or call `nextInt()`, `nextLine()`, etc., multiple times as needed.

Example:  
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);  
String name = sc.nextLine();  
int age = sc.nextInt();

4. How is switch-case different from if-else?  
| if-else                        | switch-case                  |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Supports conditions            | Only supports constants      |
| Good for range/comparisons     | Cleaner for fixed options    |
| Slower with many conditions    | More readable for discrete values |

5. What are collections in Java?  
Collections are frameworks like `List`, `Set`, and `Map` used to store and manipulate groups of objects dynamically.

6. What is ArrayList?  
ArrayList is a resizable array provided in Java Collections Framework. It allows dynamic insertion, deletion, and access of elements.

7. How to iterate using iterators?  
Use `Iterator` to traverse collections safely.

Example:  
Iterator<String> it = list.iterator();  
while(it.hasNext()) {  
    System.out.println(it.next());  
}

8. What is a Map?  
Map is a key-value pair data structure. Keys are unique, values can repeat. Example: `HashMap`, `TreeMap`.

9. How to sort a list?  
Use: `Collections.sort(list);`  
For custom sort:  
`Collections.sort(list, Comparator);`

10. How to shuffle elements?  
Use `Collections.shuffle(list);` to randomly reorder elements in a list.
